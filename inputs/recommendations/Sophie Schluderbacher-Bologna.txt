Meloncello | osteria, wanna eat amazing Italian traditional food, don’t wanna spend so much
To Steki | Greek restaurant run by crazy Greeks, authentic good food and student affordable prices
Gelateria la vecchia stalla | best ice cream, gotta order that home made panna montata!
Kinkaho (Thai) | little outside tables, chill, girl, I know it’s Italy, but you gotta try those noodles (10\15€)
Le due torri pizza | also called il mafioso (no receipts), huge pizza slices, 2€ and you’re flying

Il Barattolo | where the kids go, great for a drink and for socializing, gay friendly (also, to its left there is a place where you can buy extra cheap wine and, well, drink a lot)
Camera a sud | for a coffee, to study, for a day date, it’s a chill and cozy place
Opera Caffè Tulipani | my favorite caffè, also has some simple and good things for lunch, and a secret, walk through past the counter and sit in the back terrace facing a little river and be surrounded by plants
Naama cafè | the OG of Starbucks the Arab version, here you can taste all kinds of Arab coffees with creams, spices, and typical sweets, and it’s also good for vegans
